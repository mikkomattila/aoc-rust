# AoC-Rust

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, implemented in Rust.

## Usage

Run the program with Cargo. Specify the day of the challenge you want to execute. Optionally, you can also specify the year. If the year is not provided, the program defaults to 2024.

### Examples

With default year:

```sh
cargo run -- --day 1
```

With explicit year:

```sh
cargo run -- --day  --year 2023
```
